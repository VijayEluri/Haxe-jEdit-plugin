<h2>ActionscriptSideKick plugin</h2>
<p>
(c) 2008 by Dion Whitehead
</p>

<p>Provides a SideKick structure tree for Actionscript scripts. I wrote it because I wanted to learn writing jEdit plugins and because the "ActionscriptBrowse" plugin by Will Simpson didn't fully satisfy my needs.
ActionscriptSideKick installs itself for the "actionscript" mode and will display all package names of the current script/module in a tree. The implicit package name "main" will appear on top.
</p>

<p> Like all "SideKick" plugins, ActionscriptSideKick has no dockable
view. Instead, it shares its view with other SideKick plugins through
the SideKick Structure Browser. To use SideKick, dock the Structure
Browser on the left or the right. </p>

Global Options -&gt; Docking -&gt; Structure Browser
</pre>


<p>
In each package branch a <i>use</i> branch is added which lists all
used/required modules. Below it follows an alphabetized list of all
subroutines.  Fully qualified subroutines
(e. g. sub <i>Example::Routine</i>) are listed under their
corresponding package entries Variables are currently not supported.
</p>

<p>
The plugin parses the Actionscript source using regular expressions. An
excentric programming style will probably confuse it.
</p>

<p>
Two options can be set in the Plugin's menu:<br/>
<b>Unload sidekick structure browser</b>: Actionscriptsidekick enhances the
sidekick structure browser with a Popup menu and marker display. This
option replaces the original Sidekick structure browser and takes over
all its functionality.<br/>

<b>Show Markers</b>: Set it if you want markers to be shown in the
Structure Tree (by underlining the relative entry that contains the
marker).
